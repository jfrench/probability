# 3.3 Normal Random Variables

# Normal pdf

A continuous random variable $X$ is **normal** or **Gaussian** with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ if its pdf is

$$
f_X(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2}.
$$

We write $X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$.

## Normal pdf

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
x <- seq(-3, 5, len = 1001)
plot(x, dnorm(x, mean = 1), type = "l",
xlab = "x", ylab = "density")
title("N(1, 1) density")
```

## Mean of a normal

## Variance of a normal

## The normal is special

The standard normal random variable has mean 0 and variance 1.

**Normality is preserved by linear transformation**

If $X\sim N(0, 1)$ and $Y=\mu +\sigma X$, then
$$
Y\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2).
$$

The pdf of a standard normal is denoted by $\phi(x)$ and the cdf by $\Phi(x)$.

## Example 3.7

The annual snowfall at a location is modeld as a $N(60, 20^2)$ random variable.

What is the probability that this year's snowfall will be at least 80 inches?

## Example 3.8 Signal detection

A binary message is transmitted as a signal $s$, which is either -1 or +1.
The communication channel corrupts the transmission with additive normal noise with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$. The receive concludes that the signal -1 was transmitted if $x < 0$ or +1 if $x \geq 0$.

What is the probability of error if $\sigma=1$?
