# 3.4 Conditioning on an event

## Conditional pdf
Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with
probability density function $f_X(x)$, and let
 $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be an event such 
 that $P(X \in A) > 0$. 
 
The **conditional pdf** of X given the event $X \in A$
 is defined as:
$$
f_{X\mid A}(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{f_X(x)}{P(X \in A)} &\text{for } x \in A\\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

This ensures that the conditional pdf integrates to 1 over the set $A$, and reflects the updated distribution of $X$ under the condition that $X \in A$.

## Conditional vs unconditional pdf

## Example 3.10 Memoryless property

Sammy Jankis goes to a bus stop where the time $T$ between two successive buses has an exponential pdf with parameter $\lambda$. Suppose that Sammy arrives $t$ secs after the preceding bus
arrival and let us express this fact with the event $A = \{T > t\}$. Let X be the time
that Sammy has to wait for the next bus to arrive. What is the conditional CDF
$F_{X\mid A}(x |A)$?

## Example 3.10 (cont)

## Example 3.10 (cont)

Thus, the conditional cdf of $X$ is exponential with parameter $\lambda$, regardless
the time $t$ that elapsed between the preceding bus arrival and Sammyâ€™s arrival. 

This
is known as the **memorylessness** property of the exponential.

Generally, if we model
the time to complete a certain operation by an exponential random variable $X$,
this property implies that as long as the operation has not been completed, the
remaining time up to completion has the same exponential cdf, no matter when
the operation started.

## Conditional expectation

The conditional expectation of $X$ given the event $A$ is defined as:
$$
E(X \mid A) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
x f_{X\mid A}(x)\,dx,
$$
and
$$
E[g(X) \mid A] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
g(x) f_{X\mid A}(x)\,dx.
$$

## More conditional expectation

If $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ partition the sample space, with $P(A_i) > 0$ for all $i$, then
$$
f_X(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i) f_{X\mid A_i}(x).$$

## More conditional expectation

Additionally, in the same context,
$$
E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i) E(X \mid A_i),
$$
and
$$
E[g(X)] = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i) E[g(X) \mid A_i.
$$

## Example 3.11

Suppose that the random variable $X$ has the piecewise constant pdf
$$
f_X(x) =
\begin{cases}
1/3 &\text{if } 0\leq x \leq 1,\\
2/3 &\text{if }1< x \leq 2,\\
0 &\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

Determine the mean and variance of $X$.

## Example 3.12

The metro train arrives at the station near your home every
quarter hour starting at 6:00 AM. You walk into the station every morning between
7:10 and 7:30 AM, with the time in this interval being a uniform random variable.
What is the pdf of the time you have to wait for the first train to arrive?
