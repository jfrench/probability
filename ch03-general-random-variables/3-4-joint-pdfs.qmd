# 3.4 Joint pdfs of multiple random variables

## Jointly continuous definition
Two random variables are **jointly continuous**
with **joint pdf** $f_{X,Y}$ if there exists a
nonnegative function that satisfies
$$
P[(X,Y)\in B]=\iint \limits_{(x,y)\in B} f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dx\,dy,
$$
for any $B\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$.

## Additional properties

Additionally, a joint pdf must satisfy the normalization property of probability, i.e.,
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dx\,dy = 1.
$$

## Marginal pdf

The **marginal** pdf $f_X$ of $X$ is computed from the joint pdf by
$$
f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dy.
$$

Similarly, the marginal pdf of $Y$ is
$$
f_Y(y) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dx.
$$

## Example 3.9 Two-dimensional uniform pdf

Romeo and Juliet have a data at a given time, and each will arrive at the meeting place with a delay between 0 and 1 hour. Let $X$ and $Y$ denote the delays of Romeo and Julien, respectively, Assuming that no pairs $(x,y)$ in the unit square are more likely than others, a natural model involves a joint pdf of the form
$$
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = c I_{[0,1]}(x) I_{[0,1]}(y). 
$$
Determine $c$.

## Example 3.9 (cont)

## Example 3.10

The joint pdf of random variables $X$ and $Y$ is a constant $c$ on the set $S$ shown in the Figure below and 0 otherwise.

Determine $c$. Determine the marginal pdf of $X$ and the marginal pdf of $Y$.

## Hydration example

Josh refills his water bottle every 3 hours. Let $Y$ denote the proportion of the water bottle filled with water at the beginning of the 3-hour window. Let $X$ denote the amount of water the author consumes in the 3-hour window (measured in the the proportion of total water bottle capacity).  We know that $0\leq X \leq Y \leq 1$. The joint density of the random variables is
$$
f(x,y)=4y^2,\quad 0 \leq x\leq y\leq 1,
$$
and 0 otherwise.

## Hydration example (cont)

$P(0.5\leq X\leq 1, 0.75\leq Y)$

## Hydration example (cont)

Determine the marginal distributions of $X$ and $Y$.

## Hydration example (cont)

## Joint cdfs

The joint cdf of jointly continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ is
$$
F_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X\leq x, Y\leq y) = \int_{-\infty}^x\int_{-\infty}^y f_{X,Y}(s,t)\,dt\,ds.
$$

Converely,
$$
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y}F_{X,Y}(x,y).
$$

## Example 3.12

Determine the cdf of the following jointly continuous pdf
$$
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = I_{[0,1]}(x)I_{[0,1]}(y).
$$

## Example 3.12 (cont)

Verify the pdf from the cdf.

# Expectation

## Expected value

The expectation of a function of jointly continuous random variables is
$$
E[g(X,Y)] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x,y) f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dx\,dy.
$$

Additionally, for scalars $a$, $b$, $c$,
$$
E[aX + bY + c] = aE(X) + bE(Y) + c.
$$

## More than two random variables

The ideas presented above extend directly to multiple dimensions.

## Extended jointly continuous definition

Three random variables are **jointly continuous**
with **joint pdf** $f_{X,Y,Z}$ if there exists a
nonnegative function that satisfies
$$
P[(X,Y,Z)\in B]=\iiint \limits_{(x,y,z)\in B} f_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z)\,dx\,dy\,dz,
$$
for any $B\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$.

## Extended marginal pdf

The **marginal** pdf $f_X$ of $X$ is computed from the joint pdf by
$$
f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z)\,dy\,dz.
$$

## Expected value

The expectation of a function of jointly continuous random variables is
\begin{align}
&E[g(X,Y,Z)]\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x,y,z) f_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z)\,dx\,dy\,dz.
\end{align}

Additionally, for scalars $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$,
$$
E\left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i).
$$
