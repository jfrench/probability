# 3.2 Cumulative Distribution Functions

## Definition of the cdf

The **cumulative distribution function** or cdf of a discrete random variable is defined as

$$
F_X(x) = P(X\leq x) = \sum_{x_i \leq x} P(X = x_i).
$$

The cdf of a continuous random variable is defined as 

$$
F_X(x)=P(X\leq x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x} f_X(t)\,dt.
$$

## Comments

Informally, a cdf accumulates probabilities up to $x$.

The cdf, pmf, or pdf will be referred to as the **probability law** or **probability distribution** of the random variable $X$.

The pdf of a continuous random variable $X$ can be obtained through the relationship
$$
f_X(x) = \frac{dF_X(x)}{dx}.
$$

The cdf of a continuous random variable has no jumps.

## cdf properties

The cdf of a random variable $X$ is defined by
$$
F_X(x) = P(X\leq x), \quad \text{for all }x\in\mathbb{R}.
$$

A cdf has the following properties:

- $F_X(x)$ is monotonically increasing.
- $\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}F_X(x) = 0$.
- $\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}F_X(x) = 1$.

## More cdf properties

If $X$ is discrete, then $F_X(x)$ is a piecewise constant function of $x$.

If $X$ is continuous, then $F_X(x)$ is a continuous function of $x$.

## Some discrete cdf properties

If $X$ is discrete and takes integer values, then
$$
F_X(k) = \sum_{i=-\infty}^k p_X(i),
$$
and
\begin{align}
p_X(k) &= P(X\leq k) - P(X\leq k-1)\\
&= F_X(k) - F_X(k-1).
\end{align}

## Some continuous cdf properties

If $X$ is continuous, then
$$
F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_X(t)\, dt
$$
and
$$
f_X(x) = \frac{dF_X(x)}{dx}.
$$

## Example 3.6 The maximum of several random variables

You are allowed to take a certain test three times, and your final score will be the maximum of the test scores.

Thus,
$$
X=\max\{X_1, X_2, X_3\},
$$
where $X_1,X_2,X_3$ are the three test scores and $X$ is the final score.

Assume that your score in each test takes one of the values from 1 to 10 with equal probability $1/10$, and each test score is independent.

## Example 3.6 (cont)

What is the pmf, $p_X$, of the final score?

# The Geometric and Exponential CDFs

## The Geometric pmf and cdf

Let $X\sim \text{Geometric}(p)$, with $p\in[0, 1]$.

Then the pmf, for $k=1,2,\ldots$ is given by
<br>
<br>
$p_X(k) =$
<br>
<br>
The cdf is given by
<br>
<br>
$F_X(n) =$

## The Exponential pdf and cdf

Let $X\sim\text{Exponential}(\lambda)$ for $\lambda > 0$.

The pdf is given by
<br>
<br>
$f_X(x) =$
<br>
<br>
The cdf is given by
<br>
<br>
$F_X(x) =$

## Geometric and exponential relationship

![Relation of the geometric and exponential cdfs.](./images/f3-8.png){height=400 fig-alt="Relation of the geometric and exponential cdfs."}

## Geometric and exponential relationship

Define $\delta = -\ln(1-p)/\lambda$, so that
$$
e^{-\lambda\delta}=1-p.
$$

Then when $x=n\lambda$, with $n=1,2,\ldots$,
$$
F_{\text{exp}}(n\delta) = F_{\text{geo}}(n).
$$
